        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, World! I&apos;m Hafeez, a self-taught full-stack developer with
          a passion for building innovative web and mobile applications.
          I&apos;ve been coding since high school, and every day, I&apos;m
          passionate about solving business challenges by combining technology
          expertise with insights from business, marketing, and human
          psychology. From my early days of self-study to my current role at
          World Visa, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of
          projects, from small-scale startups to large-scale enterprise
          applications. I&apos;m proficient in a wide range of technologies,
          including JavaScript, Python, Elixir, AI, and ML. I&apos;m always
          looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. I&apos;m
          particularly interested in exploring AI and machine learning to build
          smarter and more efficient applications. I&apos;m passionate about
          reading books, collaborating with startups, exploring new hobbies,
          playing chess, and diving into intellectual conversations over a good
          cup of coffee. I also enjoy the challenge of applying programming
          concepts to solve real-world problemsâ€”it&apos;s like debugging life,
          one line at a time! Let&apos;s connect and build something amazing
          together!
